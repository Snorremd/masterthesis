Chapter introduction. Should here provide some information about which parts of the work are going to be discussed.
Should talk about the test results and how they correspond to the hypotheses. I.e. Does the testing reveal that a
better parameter set has been found than the default one. Does this parameter set perform better than the default
in different corpora? (Should perhaps test on two additional corpora?). This chapter should also investigate wether
the test results are statistically significant (can I say yes or no on the null hypotheses?). Give definitive or
estimated answer pending test results.

\section{Results}
\label{Results}
Summarize and discuss results.

\section{Validity and relevance}
\label{ValidityRelevance}
Show that data gathered are both valid and relevant. I.e. is the method of research rigorous and correct (methods of data gathering and testing).

And does the data answer the hypotheses. Also discuss the statistical significance of the data in relation to hypotheses.

\subsection{Data autenticity}
Discuss how the validity of data should not be an issue even though the algorithm is distributed. (I.e. results from clients are validated).
Algorithm deterministic...

\subsection{Effects of two different measurements}
Discuss how the varying measurements might affect the results... Does using one measurement over the
other invalidate results? Should both be used (one to measure single category documents, the other to 
measure multiple category documents)?


\subsection{Acceptance/Rejectance test}
Here I will accept or reject the hypotheses based on the discussion of the results above.
