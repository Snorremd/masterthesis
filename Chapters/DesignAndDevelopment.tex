Chapter introduction. Describe the development process in some detail. I.e. The learning phase (learning Python and familiarizing myself with the algorithm). The second stage (modifying the algorithm slightly, refactoring). Third stage (implementing a genetic algorithm with which to test different parameter sets). Fourth stage (making a distributed version of the algorithm to make testing of larger parameter sets feasible/possible). Fifth stage (final touches on the algorithm, implementing support for converting other corpora to the snippet file format). (Sixth stage) Storing results in a database and developing a method of extracting statistical numbers. Overview of system?

Describe how the algorithm and parameters where tested. I.e. how data and results were gathered. Write about different testing stages. First stage (testing individual parameter options to determine usable value ranges. Are results correct, why?). Testing of non-distributed genetic algorithm (does the small test-case give indication of viability?). Testing distributed algorithm (larger parameter sets tested show better results?). Final testing (testing hypotheses, include two corpora?).

\section{Stages of development}
This section will outline the main sequence in which work on was done.
The overview of the iterations will explain when the initial development of
the different parts were started to give an short explanation of the development process.
