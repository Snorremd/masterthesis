\section{Experimental Evaluation}
\label{ExperimentalEvaluation}
Will rewrite and use the corresponding section from the project proposal.

\subsection{Evaluation Measures}
Provide info about the two forms of evaluation measures used (one from Improved suffix tree clustering article and one used by Richard). How do they work, what are the differences...

\section{Corpora}
\label{Corpora}
Write a bit about the corpora used in the research (most likely just Klimauken and the reuters set). If time permits it could be feasible to use an additional news corpus.

\section{Experimental Research}

Rewrite and use corresponding section from project proposal. Try to flesh out the methodology a bit (how did I perform the testing, what where the hypotheses etc). Talk about experimental constraints and data used.
